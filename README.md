## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox(Responsive)

### What-I-Learned

- I learned to make multi-background image above body  with background-color instead-of using (::before,::after) pseudo elements 


```
body {
   background: url("./images/bg-pattern-top.svg") right 50vw bottom 40vh no-repeat, 
               url("./images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg") 50vw 50vh no-repeat var(--Dark-cyan);    
    }
```

### Continued development
I will use flexbox and grid template in comming Challenges with Allah willing  in professional way.


### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me for refreshing my info about flex in smart way. I really liked this guide and will use it going forward.
